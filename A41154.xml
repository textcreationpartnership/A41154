         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> I do alſo declare, in the Proſence of God, That I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of King <hi>James</hi>'s coming to <hi>Calais,</hi> nor of any Invaſion intended from thence, till it was publickly known: And the only Notion I had that ſomething might be attempted, was from the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet coming to <hi>Breſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I alſo call God to witneſs, that I receiv'd the knowledge of what is contain'd in thoſe Papers that I gave to a great Man that came to me in the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I might have expected Mercy from that Prince, becauſe I was inſtrumental in ſaving his Life: For when about <hi>April</hi> 1695, an Attempt form'd againſt him came to my knowledge, I did, partly by Diſſwaſions and partly by Delays, prevent that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; which, I ſuppoſe, was the reaſon that the laſt Vilianous Project was conceal'd from me.</p>
            <p>If there be any Perſons whom I have injur'd in Word or Deed, I heartily pray their Pardon, and beg of God to pardon thoſe who have injurd me, particularly thoſe who with great Zeal have ſought my Life, and brought the Guilt of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood upon this Nation, no Treaſon being prov'd upon me.</p>
            <p>I return my moſt hearty Thanks to thoſe noble and worthy Perſons who gave me their Aſſiſtance, by oppoſing this Bill of Attainder, without which it had been impoſſible I could have fal'n under the Sentence of <hi>Death:</hi> God bleſs them and their Poſterity, tho' I am fully ſatisfied they pleaded their own Cauſe while they defended mine.</p>
            <p>I pray God to bleſs my true and lawful Soveraign King <hi>James,</hi> the Queen, and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and reſtore him and his Poſterity to this Throne again, for the Peace and Proſperity of this Nation, which is impoſſible to proſper till the Covern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſetled upon a right Foot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, O GOD, I do with all humble Devotion commend my Soul into thy Hands, the great Maker and Preſerver of Men, and Lover of Souls, beſeeching thee, that it may be always dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in thy ſight, through the Merits of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Amen.</p>
